# Employee-Attrition
## Agenda:
The main objective is to determine whether the employee will leave the company or not. We can achieve this by using multiple algorithms/Statistical Techniques.
To determine whether the employee will leave the company or not, we have to analyse the respective predictors or supporting features like Age, City, Salary etc.

## Data Pre-processing:
•	In the current dataset, the response variable is not given directly. Instead of that they had given the last working date. By using python code we created a new variable called   ‘Target’ and assigned values by using last working date variable
•	I analysed each feature to know the Insights of that feature. I achieved this by using different plots like Histogram, Boxplot, countplot etc
•	I used the Standard Scaler to standardize the numerical features, it transformed the numerical features values between the range -1 to 1
•	The categorical features are labelled into the numerical values using Label Encoder
•	In the current dataset, the values of Target variable are unbalanced. To balance the data, we used SMOTE method to balance the data
•	Grouping is performed on Employee id by averaging the Total Business Value as there are repeated records with same Employee Id with only Total Business Value changing.

## Statistical Techniques/Algorithms:
•	For the current dataset, we used multiple machine learning algorithms like DecisionTree Classifier, RandomForest Classifier, etc.
•	But, svm/Support Vector Classifier gives us maximum accuracy(73.07%) with respect to public test data.
•	So, I am using the svm algorithm to predict whether the employee will leave the company or not.

## Further Improvements: 
We can further improve our model by applying different hyperparameter tuning techniques for respective algorithms.
